Looking at increasing interest of developers in building creative user interfaces(UI), in Feb 2018 [GDG Baroda](https://gdgbaroda.com/) oraganized meetup on [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/) which is JavaScript framework for building different types of UIs. When attendees got confirmation for this meetup, they were really excited, as they were going to learn something new & creative in this meetup. This meetup was lead by GDG Baroda co-organizer [Manan Jadhav](https://twitter.com/curosmj), as a speaker for meetup. Meetup began in the rocking way with introduction to Vue.JS.

### What is Vue.JS?
Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue) is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Integration into projects that use other JavaScript libraries is simplified with Vue because it is designed to be incrementally adoptable. Vue can also function as a web application framework capable of powering advanced single-page applications. Vue.js is a popular JavaScript front-end framework that was built to organize and simplify web development.The project focuses on making ideas in web UI development (components, declarative UI, hot-reloading, time-travel debugging, etc.) more approachable. It attempts to be less opinionated and thus easier for developers to pick up. It features an incrementally adoptable architecture. The core library focuses on declarative rendering and component composition and can be embedded into existing pages. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages. Vue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instance’s data. Attendees performed hands-on demo on Vue.JS by which they came to know how it actually works. For demo, [click here](https://github.com/CurosMJ/vue-demos).

### Why Vue.JS?
It one or other way it becomes mandatory for web developers to make use of Vue.JS due to the benefits of its features. Vue.JS is so easy to learn & get started with. Developers can use Vue.JS even without jQuery. Vue.JS has good performance in runtime & efforts optimization. When developers are dealing with front end development, they often try to combine and reduce our files down to the smallest possible size. Vue.js by itself comes in at a small 21kb download, which compared to other frameworks, is one of the smallest out there. Developers are free to break down each section of our code into reusable bits that all contain the logic they require in one small bundle. Vue.js does a great job with this, in that everything is a component. This is little bit small change from other frameworks where you may have a route, controller, view, and even component file.We use Node.js for our back-end development on most projects and as work continues, we all learn and develop better standards when using JavaScript. While front-end development is very heavy in JavaScript already, it reinforces our knowledge of JavaScript to be able to write plain JavaScript in Vue.js. You know what, the documentation is almost like reading a book on Vue.js. It’s easy to understand and pick up while helping guide you through the entire library.  One more thing, when we ask a front-end developer what framework they use, we’ll often hear two main answers come up: Angular and React. We can agree that they’re both great in their own way, but for us, we evaluated Angular on the idea that we would jump into Angular 2. Vue.JS is a best alternative for these due its simplicity. So, this was all about using Vue.JS.

### Advantages of Vue.JS
There are multiple advantages of using Vue.JS. Because it is damn simple to code in Vue.JS. It is very easy to learn & understand Vue.JS. It provides functionalities like consuming less space & it even provides flexibility to the developers. One of the best features of Vue.JS is it uses virtual DOM & that makes it really faster. One of the main advantages of using Vue.JS is its small size. Size is considered to be the main constraint in using any development framework. But this is not true that it has low speed due to small size. Instead, it beats all the bulky frameworks like React.js, Angular.js, and Ember.js. One of the reasons for the popularity of this framework is that it is quite easy to understand. In case of any problem, the user can easily trace the blocks with errors. All this is because of its simple structure.Vue.js is also popular among the web developers because it facilitates them to integrate with the existing applications. This is because it is based on JavaScript framework and can be integrated into other applications built on JavaScript. This means that it is useful for developing new web applications as well as altering the pre-existing applications. This integration is possible because Vue.js has components for everything. Developers always like to use the framework with detailed documentation because it is always easy for them to write their first application. Vue.JS provides simplicity in documentation, it is so simple that any user who knows a little about JavaScript and HTML can develop his own application or web page. Attendees were so confident about their interest in web development after having their hands-on practice on Vue.JS.

In the end, just wanna say that Vue.JS has really loved by the attendees, due to its features & creativity.

Enthusiasts always learn with fun & joy when it comes about [GDG Baroda](https://gdgbaroda.com/).

That's it for today's post. We'll continue our journey in upcoming post.
